# PythonCompiler

A fun project that simulates a "fake python" programming language by:
- Compiling "fake python" syntax into a simplified assembly language code
- Then using an assembler to translate hte assembly code into machine code
- Then executing the machine code on a verilog processor

*Verilog processor original code by Mr Gwilt (then modified)
